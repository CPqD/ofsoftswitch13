/* High-level wrapper around the "poll" system call.
 *
 * Intended usage is for the program's main loop to go about its business
 * servicing whatever events it needs to.  Then, when it runs out of immediate
 * tasks, it calls each subordinate module's "wait" function, which in turn
 * calls one (or more) of the functions poll_fd_wait(), poll_immediate_wake(),
 * and poll_set_timer_wait() to register to be awakened when the appropriate event
 * occurs.  Then the main loop calls poll_block(), which blocks until one of
 * the registered events happens.
 *
 * There is also some support for autonomous subroutines that are executed by
 * poll_block() when a file descriptor becomes ready.  To prevent these
 * routines from starving if events are continuously ready, the application
 * should bound the amount of work it does between poll_block() calls. */
